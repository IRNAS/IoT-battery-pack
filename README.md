## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

IoT battery pack is an universal solution for solar powered IoT projects implementing all commonly required features, such as charging, battery monitoring and voltage regulations, to solve these repeating requirements for a number of projects, creating a cost and convenience benefit for developers and manufacturers of IoT systems. Due to the modular structure one can either use this as a set of modules to be included in the target application or simply pack a mother board with a number of modules required for a particular system.

The system is broken down into standalone modules one can combine in a number of ways.

## Charging modules
Charging modules provide the interface between a power source and the single cell battery.

 * USB charger: Designed to charge via a standard microUSB: 5V/2A
   * auto-disconnect when not plugged in
 * Solar charger: Designed to charge from a solar cell with MPPT : 4.95-32V IN / 2A charging [LT3552](http://www.linear.com/product/LT3652)
   * protection diode for panel
   * adjustable MPPT point

## Output modules
Providing useful output for various applications.

 * Fixed regulator: 3.3V/2A or 5V/1.5A
   * External enable OR Under-voltage OR allways-on
 * Adjustable regulator: 3-5V/1.5A
   * External enable OR Under-voltage OR allways-on
 * High-side switched battery output: 2A+
 * Higher voltage regulator: 24V/300mA
   * adjustable voltage

## Battery modules
Interfacing the battery to the rest of the circuitry.

 * Battery protection module:
   * Over-voltage
   * Under-voltage
 * Battery charge controller - fuel gauge via I2C

## Backplane modules
General purpose or application specific, simple power routing board that can be easily developed and soldered.

 * General purpose backplane
   * Up to 2 charging modules
   * Up to 4 output modules
   * One battery protection module
   * One battery monitoring module
   * 6-8x 18650 socket
   * Nodemcu V2 socket
   * SSD1306 display connector

## Connection pinout

In the picture bellow is the diagram of the connector J25 which is a standard header with 2.54 mm pitch and it provides output power and communication pins:
